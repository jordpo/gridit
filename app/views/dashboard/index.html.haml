%h1 What does this app do?
%p Using the correlation that gas and electric bills tend to have with weather temperature, this app simply applies linear regression to 'predict' what your next next month's bill will be. The more you use it, the more accurate predictions will be, as well as taking full advantage of the historical bill tracker.
